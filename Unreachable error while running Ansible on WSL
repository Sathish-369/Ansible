If you encounter an unreachable error while running Ansible commands on WSL, follow these troubleshooting steps:

 
    Ping the Target Server:
    Attempt to ping the target server. If unsuccessful, check the network connectivity.

    Ping External IP (e.g., 8.8.8.8):
    If the initial ping fails, try pinging an external IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8). If successful, it indicates a potential DNS issue.

    Check DNS Server in CMD:
    Open CMD and find the DNS server IP using the command:

ipconfig -all

Take note of the DNS server IP.

Verify DNS Server in resolv.conf:
Navigate to the resolv.conf file in WSL and confirm that it contains the same DNS server IP obtained from CMD.

Edit resolv.conf if Necessary:
If the DNS server IP is not present in resolv.conf, open the file using a text editor such as VIM or nano:
vim /etc/resolv.conf

Add the DNS server details, save the file, and exit (use 'esc' key, type ':wq!', and press Enter in VIM).

Save and Run Command:
Save the changes to resolv.conf and then rerun the Ansible command.
